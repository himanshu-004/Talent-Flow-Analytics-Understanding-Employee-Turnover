## Description and deliverables
This capstone project focuses on analyzing employee data to build a predictive model that provides valuable insights for the Human Resources (HR) department of a large consulting firm. The goal is to determine whether an employee is likely to leave the company using either a regression-based or machine learning approach.

As part of the project, I developed two key deliverables:

1️⃣ A One-Page Summary – A concise report designed for external stakeholders, summarizing the project’s objectives, methodology, key findings, and business impact.

2️⃣ A Complete Code Notebook – A well-documented Jupyter Notebook showcasing data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, evaluation, and key visualizations.
